# HackOHIO
For this year's HACK OHI/O project, we chose to tackle the Engie project.
We created an interactive, educational dashboard of OSU's energy usage that's user-friendly for people who aren't familiar with energy units or what they mean. 

The landing page, built with HTML and CSS, allows the reader to select options that then display data in a bubble chart, made with JavaScript.
